    \brief Fast Marching Method using a Binary Heap
    
    It uses as a main container the nDGridMap class. The nDGridMap type T
    has to be an FMCell or something inherited from it.
    
    The leafsize of the grid map is ignored since it has to be >=1 and that 
    depends on the units employed.
    
    This method is introduced in the paper "3D Distance Fields: A Survey of Techniques and Applications"
    M.W. Jones, J.A. Baerentzen and M. Sramek, 2006.
    * 
    However, in this implementation, the results are not that satistactory as in their paper. In fact, 
    this method is much slower than the standard FMM.
